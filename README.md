I have taken bike purchasing dataset to build a dashboard.
ID	Marital Status	Gender	Income	Children	Education	Occupation	Home Owner	Cars	Commute Distance	Region	Age	Purchased Bike. These are variables given to analyse the target variable.
We have to find whether the person purchased a bike or not.
I have took occupation, commute distance, gender to identify the pattern in the target variable.
The data was not clean so i cleaned the data using find & replace function.
Then i used income average with gender to find th impact.
